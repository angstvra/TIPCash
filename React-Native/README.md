## Issues
<ul>
  <li>The login page lacks a proper backend, allowing access to the home page without entering account data.</li>
  <li>Balance data is not being saved due to the absence of a database to store the balance information.</li>
  <li>The "add balance" and "withdraw" functionalities are not working correctly. When adding balance, the current balance returns null if the user doesn't specify an amount. When withdrawing, the current balance returns a negative number. Additionally, the implemented conditional check for withdrawing an amount greater than the balance is not functioning as intended.</li>
  <li>The "report problem" feature lacks functionality.</li>
</ul>

## Goals: 
<ul>
  <li>Implement a database to store user account information.</li>
  <li>Connect balance data to the database, associating it with specific user accounts.</li>
  <li>Implement checks to prevent adding a null amount and to prevent users from withdrawing more than their balance.</li>
  <li>Enhance the "report problem" feature to notify the admin whenever a user submits an issue within the app.</li>
</ul>
